# Supported Formats

This page will provide you with the supported localization formats that <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> can handle, and some conditions that you should be aware of.

## JSON

<a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">
  LangSyncw
</a> supports primarily JSON files, since it is the most common format for localization
files, these are some things that you should be aware of when using JSON files:

<details><summary>The JSON file must be a valid JSON file</summary>

You can check if your JSON file is valid by using [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/), or by relying on the IDE that you are using to validate the JSON file.

 </details>

<details><summary>The localization JSON file should be an object</summary>

This means that you can't have an array as the root of the JSON file, for example:

```json
// ❌ Invalid JSON file
[
  {
    "key": "value"
  }
]
```

```json
// ✅ Valid JSON file
{
  "key": "value"
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>The JSON file should be a flat object</summary>

<a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">
  LangSync
</a> accepts only flat JSON objects, this means that you can't have nested objects,
for example:

```json
// ❌ Invalid JSON file
{
  "key": {
    "nestedKey": "value"
  }
}
```

```json
// ✅ Valid JSON file
{
  "key": "value",
  "nestedKey": "value"
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>The variables are ignored and not modified</summary>
<a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> recognise a variable when it sees it, you can have any many differet variables syntaxes as you want, and <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> will ignore them and not modify them, for example:

```json
// ✅ Valid JSON file
{
  "key": "value",
  "nestedKey": "value",
  "keyWithVariable": "Hello {{name}}!"
}
```

```json
// ✅ Valid JSON file
{
  "key": "value",
  "nestedKey": "value",
  "keyWithVariable": "Hello %%name%%!",
  "keyWithMultipleVariables": "Hello %%firstName%% %%lastName%%!"
}
```
