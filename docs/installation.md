To embark on your journey with LangSync CLI, ensure you have the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) SDK installed on your machine (compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux). If you haven't installed Dart yet, follow the steps outlined in [Installing the Dart SDK.](https://dart.dev/get-dart#install).

Once Dart is set up, install LangSync CLI with a simple command:

```bash
dart pub global activate langsync
```

After the installation, you should now be able to use the `langsync` command in your terminal from any directory. to confirm that, open your command line/terminal and run:

```langsync
langsync --version
```

```langsync
0.9.4
```

## Next Steps
