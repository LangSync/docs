# LangSync

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

LangSync is an AI powered Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows you to target the global market for your software (apps, websites, games, projects...) by processing your original JSON files for one laungage, then with the help of a powerful set of AI engines it generates very accurate other laungages localization & translations that stays in your software context.

As example, if you have a mobile app that supports only the English laungage, which saves all its translations in a `en.json` file, you can literally support any other laungaues by a runinng a simple command, then see our magic happen.

## Key Features

- **AI Powered**: LangSync make uses of very powerful AI models to localize your software, making sure that everything matches its context.

- **Accurate & precise**: Having the most accuracy possible is what matters to LangSync, And because the pre-trained AI models we use, the generated language-specific localization texts will match the sens of the original ones, instead of the direct common translation services out there.

- **Configurable**: Well this is obvious, right? LangSync allows you to make a very straitforward configuration of what you will provide (your original localization file) and what we will provide (the generated new localization files).

- **Easy to use**: LangSync is a CLI tool that is made by a developer for other developers. it exposes direct commands achieve what you want, And the very beginner developer can literally follow our guides & documentation to use it.

- **Not Only For developers**: LangSync is for everyone. if you have or can provide only one JSON file of one laungage translations, then you can generate 10 more, if you are not familiar with CLIs and terminal... don"t worry, LangSync will come as a UI-based software too! subscribe to our email list in order to be the first to try it.

## How it works?

Let's take a real-world use case to demonstrate what you will really get and how it will benefit you. And so, let's say you're a developer who works on a server-side project with NodeJS, Asuuming this file structure:

```bash title="📁 .../my-nodejs-projects"

my-project
│
├── .node_modules
│   └── ...
│
├── locales
# highlight-next-line
│   └── en.json
│
├── src
│   └── server.js
│
└── package.json

```

This server intends to receive some requests, and returns a localization file to the client so it will use it, this project is really just for demonstrating purpose and not specific, As you can have a Flutter, javascript, electron, laravel, rust, c... projects, the usage sremains the same.

<br />

Let's see what `en.json` contains:

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="en.json" label="en.json">

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "hello": "Hello",
  "world": "World",
  "welcome": "Welcome to my NodeJS project"
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that you want to reach the global market, your software wants to supports more languages

let's say you want to target the **Spanish**, **Arabic**, **German**, **italian** and **Chinese** languages, you will literally need to run a simple command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="Powershell" >

```powershell
langsync start
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cmd" label="CMD">

```cmd
langsync start
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">

```bash
$ langsync start
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

That's it, now what you will do is to take a short break or prepare another cup of coffee. After the file gets processed by our AI models and finished it's localization, you must see something like this on your terminal:

```bash
Localizing process starting..
✓ Your langsync.yaml file and configuration are valid. (1ms)
✓ Your source file has been saved succesfully. (1.4s)
[WARN] The ID of this operation is: 24332154-668f-4b5d-9a12-173d5ffa252c. in case of any issues, please contact us providing this ID so we can help.
✓ Localization operation is completed successfully. (94.6s)


Generating localization files: es.json, ar.json, de.json, it.json, zh.json:
✓ file es.json is created succesfully, ./locales/es.json (1ms)
✓ file ar.json is created succesfully, ./locales/ar.json (1ms)
✓ file de.json is created succesfully, ./locales/de.json (0ms)
✓ file it.json is created succesfully, ./locales/it.json (1ms)
✓ file zh.json is created succesfully, ./locales/zh.json (0ms)
All files are created succesfully.
All done!
```

Congratulations, This was a success message and you have now a new langauge localization under the `locales` folder.

Your project folder structure is now:

```bash title="📁 .../my-nodejs-projects"

myProject
│
├── .node_modules
│   └── ...
│
├── locales
│   ├── en.json
# highlight-start
│   ├── es.json
│   ├── ar.json
│   ├── de.json
│   ├── it.json
│   └── zh.json
# highlight-end
│
├── src
│   └── index.js
│
└── package.json

```

These are the content of the new localization files:

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="es.json" label="es.json">

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "hello": "Hola",
  "world": "Mundo",
  "welcome": "Bienvenido a mi proyecto de NodeJS"
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="ar.json" label="ar.json" default>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "hello": "مرحبا",
  "world": "العالم",
  "welcome": "مرحبا بك في مشروعي NodeJS"
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="de.json" label="de.json">

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "hello": "Hallo",
  "world": "Welt",
  "welcome": "Willkommen zu meinem NodeJS Projekt"
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="it.json" label="it.json">

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "hello": "Ciao",
  "world": "Mondo",
  "welcome": "Benvenuto al mio progetto NodeJS"
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="zh.json" label="zh.json">

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "hello": "你好",
  "world": "世界",
  "welcome": "欢迎来到我的NodeJS项目"
  ...
}
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

<br />

Wasn't that hard, isn't it?

## What's Next?

After having a general overviewover LangSync, let's dive into the [installation](./installation).
