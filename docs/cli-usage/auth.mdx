# Authentication

This page will guide you through the authentication process with the CLI.

## How Authentication Work

LangSync is really a tool that is made to help, and not to make it hard to use. you only need to create your own API key, authenticate LangSync with, then start your usage.

## Create your account and API key

In order to create your own LangSync account and get your API key, all you need to do is run the following command:

```bash
$ langsync account apiKey
```

it will only ask you to provide a username identifier for that API key, we need you to do that in order to identify you if you faced any issues and you want us to help you:

```bash
Please enter your desired username (will be used to identify you): _
```

After your API key os created, you should have a success message with it, something like:

```bash
API key created successfully! (3.6s)


Your API key: 389f5a2bba878e87f88460ab7264204a16b8624016591ef8e32d33208d06d36e

```

:::note
Please make sure to copy & save your API key somewhere safe, as you won't be able to retrieve it again!
:::

Your API key is the only piece that you will need to [authenticate now](#logging-in-to-your-account).

## Logging in to your account

After [creating your own API key](#create-your-account-and-api-key), In order to configure it with LangSync, you will need to run the following command:

```bash
langsync account auth
```

You will be prompted to enter that API key:

```bash
Please, provide your account API key to authenticate.
You can find & manage your API keys from your dashboard.

Enter API key here: _
```

Paste it in and hit enter, then wait for LangSync to save it.

## Checking your account stats & info

At any point of using our CLI, you can always check your account information & stats by running the following command:

```bash
langsync account info
```

This will fetch your account stats, and show them like:

```bash
fetched account's information successfully. (0.8s)
