# Start Translation process

After you setup everything from [authenticating to LangSync](./auth) and [configuring](./configure) it for your own project with a `langsync.yaml` file, all what is left is the actual magic to happen, right?

For this, open your terminal, CMD or PowerShell.. under your project filter path, then run:

```langsync
langsync start
```

This command will start the AI localization & translation process, showing you a verbose logging of the progress that is made in real-time.

:::note
This might take a while, depending on the size of your source file and the number of target languages. so the best thing you can do is to get yourself a cup of coffee and wait for the magic to happen.
:::

After everything succeed, you will see a success message like:

```langsync
Localizing process starting..
✔️ Your langsync.yaml file and configuration are valid. (0ms)
✔️ Your source file has been saved successfully
. (1.5s)
[WARN] The ID of this operation is: 1bea0aa9-cfba-401b-8912-6993f24c8057. in case of any
issues, please contact us providing this ID so we can help.
✔️ Localization operation is completed successfully. (50.0s)


Generating localization files: fr.json, de.json, ar.json, de.json, zh.json:
✔️ file fr.json is created successfully, ./example/locales/fr.json (1ms)
✔️ file de.json is created successfully, ./example/locales/de.json (1ms)
✔️ file ar.json is created successfully, ./example/locales/ar.json (0ms)
✔️ file de.json is created successfully, ./example/locales/de.json (11ms)
✔️ file zh.json is created successfully, ./example/locales/zh.json (8ms)
All files are created successfully

All done!
```

After this process is done, as that message covers, you will find the new localization files in the output directory (in this case, it is the `./example/locales` directory) which is changeable in the `langsync.yaml` configuration file.

Have a look & review those files.

:::info
In case of any error during the process, like if your internet is cut off or some other reason, feel free to save the operation ID which is shown in the response message and contact us with it describing the issue so **we can help**.

## What happens under the hood?

In simple terms, this process is splitt to many tasks that are listed below:

- Uploading your source file to our servers.
- AI processing of that file, our engines start to evaluate and get to understand its content & get familiar with it.
- AI localization & translations to your target languages one by one. (The time that is taken by this really depends on the size of your source file).
- Once everything is ready, LangSync will start distributing the results to the output directory that you configured, each to its relevant file.
- And Done, you should now go checking them by yourself.

## Error handling

Sometimes, and especially at this starting stage of LangSync, unexpected errors may happen due to any kind of reason while localizing & translating to a specific language, LangSync will create special kind of JSON files (\*.error.json) that includes details of the error, as example if the error occurs while localizing & translation to the de language, a `de.error.json` will be created containing details:

```json
{
  "error": "...",
  "partitionId": "...",
  "lang": "..",
  "LocalizationTryDate": "..",
  "message": "..."
}
```

And you will need to contact us with this in order to look into it and be able to help and provide more practical ways to get over them.
