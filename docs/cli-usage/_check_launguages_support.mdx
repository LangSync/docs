# Check Launguages Support

<a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">
  LangSync
</a> offer some handy utils to help its users, one of them is the ability of users
to check if they can localize and translate to language X before starting the actual
process, in this guide we will show you how you can as well.

## When to use this?

Putting the fact that LangSync is using AI models & engines in order to get you the best results, all ISO 939-1 code languages are supported and you can work with them just fine. However, LangSync is not a magic tool that will know all imaginary or fantasy languages, and so, in order to confirm if LangSync knows them, you will need to [check yourself](#check-languages-support)

## Check Languages Support

In order to check if LangSync recognize a single or set of Launguage(s), all you need to do is run the following command:

```langsync
langsync supported-languages
```

This will prompt you to write the languages you want to check, they should be comma separated, as example

```langsync
What language(s) do you want to check? (comma separated):  arabic, japanese, english, german, turkish, somethingElse
```

**Notice that all are valid languages except "somethingElse".**

After LangSync checks for each language support, it will show the check result like this:

```langsync
Done checking languages support. (1.8s)

The language arabic is supported.
The language japanese is supported.
The language english is supported.
The language german is supported.
The language turkish is supported.
The language somethingElse is not supported.
```

and with this, you can be sure that you can [start your localization process](./start-tranlations) with the ones that are marked with "supported".
