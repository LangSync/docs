# Configuration

This page will teach you how to configure & influence <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> for your own needs and for your own project, this includes locating up your original localization file, the target new localizations languages, and the output directory and much more..

<a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">
  {" "}
  LangSync{" "}
</a> configurations is basically represented in a special file that will live in
your project root directory, we support different formats for LangSync configuration,
you can specify and have the one you prefer, we currently support the `yaml` and
`json` formats, and so the configuration file can be either `langsync.yaml` or `langsync.json`.

<br />
<br />

That file will be read and used each time you [start the localization process](./start-tranlations), so by just modifying it, you modify
the whole behavior of <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank"> LangSync </a> and so you get the flexibility to change it as you want and as your project needs.

You can either create and modify that file manually by creating and naming that file and so fill it with your configurations, or you can make your life much easier by running the config creation [command](#creating-your-configuration-file) which we recommend since
it validates your configuration before saving it in case you have any mistakes.

## Creating your configuration file

From your project directory, run the following command:

```langsync
langsync config create
```

<br />

:::tip
By default running `langsync config create` will create a `langsync.yaml` file, if you want to create a `langsync.json` file instead, you can run `langsync config create --json`.
:::

<br />

This will prompt you to input all the necessary parameters and configurations as questions that you will need to answer such the path of the output directory, the target localization languages and more.

:::info
if the the configuration file already exists in your project directory, <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> will notify you about that and ask you if you want to override it or not.
:::

After you do write & put all your configuration options, you will notice that a `langsync.yaml` or `langsync.json` file has been created in your project directory, and so you are ready to start the localization process.

Example of a `langsync.yaml` looks like:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="langsync.yaml" label="langsync.yaml" default>

```yaml
langsync:
  source: "./example/locales/en.json"
  output: "./example/locales"
  target: [fr, de, ar, de, zh]
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="langsync.json" label="langsync.json">

```json
{
  "langsync": {
    "source": "./example/locales/en.json",
    "output": "./example/locales",
    "target": ["fr", "de", "ar", "de", "zh"]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Check [configuration options](#configuration-options) section to learn about all the possible configuration you can specify.

## Future Configuration Options

These are the future configuration options that will be added to <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> soon..

| Option        | Description                                                                                                                                  | Type     |

| `instruction` | Any additional instructions that you want to inform the AI engine about, this can be useful if you want a special behavior for your process. | `string` |

<br />

## Additional Notes:

- if two or more configuration files are found in your project directory, such having both `langsync.yaml` and `langsync.json`, <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> will not prioritize one over the other, instead it will throw an error and ask you to remove one of them or rename it.
- if none of the configuration files are found in your project directory, <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> will throw an error and ask you to create one of them.

## Next Steps

After you have configured <a href="https://langsync.app" target="_blank">LangSync</a> to your project needs, all what is left is start the localization process, see the [Translation](./start-tranlations) page for more details.
