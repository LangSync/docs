# Configuration

This page will teach you how to configure & influence LangSync to your own needs inside your project, including setting up your original localization file, the target new localizations languages, and the output directory..

LangSync configurations is basically represented in a `langsync.yaml` file that will live in your project root directory, that file will be read and used each time you [start the localization process](./start-tranlations), so by just modifying it, you modify the whole behavior of LangSync.

You can either create and modify that file manually, or by using LangSync [config command](#creating-your-configuration-file) which we recommend since it validates your configuration before saving it.

## Creating your configuration file

From your project directory, create a new `langsync.yaml` file by running the following command:

```langsync
langsync config create
```

This will prompt you to input all the necessary options in format of questions that you will need to answer such the path of the output directory, the target localization languages..

:::note
if a `langsync.yaml` already exists in your project directory, LangSync will notify you about that and ask you about overwriting it.
:::

After you do set all your configuration options, you will notice that a `langsync.yaml` file is created in your project directory.

Example of a `langsync.yaml` looks like:

```yaml
langsync:
  source: "./example/locales/en.json"

  output: "./example/locales"

  target: [fr, de, ar, de, zh]
```

Check [configuration options](#configuration-options) section to learn about all the possible configuration you can have.

## Configuration Options

LangSync configuration options:

- `source`: The JSON source file that contains your current software localizations for a certain languauge, it must be a file path.

- `output`: The directory where the new generated localizations JSON files will be put inside, it must be a directory path.

- `target`: The new languages which you want to localize your software with, it must be a list of languages names. (We recommend following the the [List of ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for languages).

:::note
The languages names you do specify in the `target` configuration will be the names of the output files. as example, the localization file for the `de` will be saved as `de.json`.

## Next Steps

After you have configured LangSync to your project needs, all what is left is start the localization process, see the [Translation](./start-tranlations) page for more details.
